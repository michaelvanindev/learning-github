# Learning GitHub

Welcome to my "Learning GitHub" repository! This repo is dedicated to tracking my journey of learning Git, GitHub, and version control over the next year. I'll be using this repository to practice Git commands, explore GitHub features, and document my progress as I go along. 

This is a personal project to improve my web development skills, and it will include notes, mini-projects, and tasks that I complete along the way. The purpose of this repository is to get hands-on experience with Git and GitHub workflows and use version control effectively in real-world development.

## Learning Goals
I have set the following learning goals for myself over the course of the next year:

- **Understand Git Basics**: Initialize repositories, make commits, and track changes.
- **Master Branching and Merging**: Create branches, switch between them, merge changes, and handle merge conflicts.
- **Work with Remote Repositories**: Clone repos, push changes, pull updates, and collaborate using GitHub.
- **Pull Requests & Code Review**: Learn to create and review pull requests, resolve conflicts, and manage code collaboration workflows.
- **Explore GitHub Features**: Experiment with advanced GitHub features like Actions, Pages, and Projects.

## Git Commands and Concepts

This section is where I'll document the basic and advanced Git commands I learn along the way. Below is a summary of the initial concepts I'm focusing on:

### Git Basics
- **`git init`**: Initialize a new Git repository.
- **`git add <file>`**: Stage changes to be committed.
- **`git commit -m "message"`**: Commit staged changes with a message.
- **`git status`**: View the current state of the repository.

### Branching & Merging
- **`git branch`**: List all branches and create new ones.
- **`git checkout <branch>`**: Switch between branches.
- **`git merge <branch>`**: Merge changes from one branch into another.
- **`git pull`**: Fetch changes from a remote repository.

### Remote Repositories
- **`git clone <repo>`**: Clone a repository from GitHub or another remote location.
- **`git push`**: Push changes to a remote repository.
- **`git fetch`**: Retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging them.
- **`git pull origin <branch>`**: Pull changes from a specific branch on the remote.

## Weekly Progress

Each week, I will document the specific Git and GitHub topics I focus on in this section, including exercises and mini-projects I complete.

### Week 1: Git Basics
- Learned how to initialize a Git repository.
- Created the first commit with basic files.
- Practiced using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git status`.

### Week 2: Branching and Merging
- Learned to create and switch between branches using `git branch` and `git checkout`.
- Merged branches and resolved conflicts.

### Week 3: Working with Remote Repositories
- Cloned repositories and pushed changes to GitHub.
- Collaborated by creating pull requests and reviewing code.
